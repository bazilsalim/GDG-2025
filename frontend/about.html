        <h2>🌱 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At FarmConnect Direct, we aim to empower local farmers by eliminating middlemen and enabling direct sales to customers. By prioritizing localized selling, we ensure that farmers connect with customers in their own districts, reducing unnecessary transportation costs and making fresh produce more accessible. Our goal is to support local agriculture 🧑‍🌾, ensure fair pricing 💰, and strengthen rural economies🌾.</p>
        <h2>🔍 How It Works</h2>
        <p>Customers begin by selecting their state and district 📍 to browse products from nearby farmers. Farmers can list their produce 🥦🍎 with images, pricing, and contact details 📞. Buyers can then directly call the farmers to negotiate and arrange purchases. This simple farm-to-table connection ensures that farmers receive fair prices while customers get fresh, locally sourced produce 🚜🥕.</p>
